StreamLedger Project Overview
Purpose: Automate creation of curated M3U playlist (~400-500 English channels from CA, US, UK, AU) and matching EPG for TiviMate, using public sources. Filter to specific regions/networks/specialties, exclude unwanted categories, validate streams, update via GitHub Actions.
Architecture:

Repo root folders: config/, src/, functions/, outputs/, cache/, logs/, archive/, docs/
config/streamledger.yml: Single source of truth (sources, include/exclude, regions, validation)
config/manual_overrides.yaml: GUI-saved user overrides
functions/: Reusable helpers (http.py fetch/head, m3u.py read/write/parse, paths.py)
src/: Pipeline scripts
download_sources.py: Fetch M3U/EPG to cache
parse_m3u.py / filter_playlist.py: Parse, filter, de-duplicate
validate_streams.py: HEAD check alive streams
build_epg.py: Merge EPG sources for curated channels
write_outputs.py: Write outputs/curated.m3u + curated_epg.xml.gz
gui_channel_selector.py: PyQt6 GUI for manual channel tweaks
run_pipeline.py: Entry point (orchestrates all)
test_pipeline.py: Validate count/coverage

.github/workflows/update.yml: Cron every 6 hours, run pipeline, commit outputs

Workflow:

One-time: Run GUI for manual overrides (optional)
Local: python -m src.run_pipeline from repo root
Auto: GitHub Actions updates outputs/
TiviMate: Use raw GitHub URLs for curated.m3u and curated_epg.xml.gz

Dependencies: requirements.txt (requests, PyYAML, PyQt6)
Status: Functional core pipeline; run local first to generate outputs.

Here is the workflow that was design but has not been eplosed with helper functions, which i think is uneeded.
